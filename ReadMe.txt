Hi there,

if you are going to use the program, feel free to go through the codes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Please, follow the following steps to use the python programs:
		
1. If you are going to use this code for the ""1st TIME""
-->RUN "1_first_time_program" 

   Then, this particular python file is not required to be used in any way ahead.
 
2. Then, RUN "2_monthly_utility_bill_evaluator" every month to calculate the total electricity bill.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The additional files are underway construction which includes:

3. "3_display_total_bill" which will output the total bill of a month for a particular room or
    all the rooms in a visually appealing format.

4. "4_query_run" which will allow the users to run any kinds of query such as displaying the unit of electricity, amount of 
    electricity, water, cleanliness, total bill and so on. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary objective of the project:
The primary objective of creating this program is to reduce the time the long time consuming calcuations and billing stuffs. And 
the aim is also to produce a bill in a easier way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Long-term goal:
The goal is to create a web-platform that links with the python and MySQL such that the user get the visually attractive and
appealing platform to work on. This will make the application even more useful to other people besides me.

Furthermore, the goal extends to creating a mobile application that does provide more ooptions to users to customize the 
application based on their need with few easy steps and then, allow the  users to generate bills easily.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why do we need it while we may have other technology to do the similar things easily?

1. The tech is not available in the lower income, lower and medium developing nations where the house owners rely on their own calculations 
and manual work to calculate and generate the bills. Hence, this application serves to benefit them.

2. Also, this application will be in more optimized form where the user can modify the application for their purpose and make the 
work simple and easier.
